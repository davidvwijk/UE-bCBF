## Supplemental Video: Quadrotor Example
The objective is to prevent the quadrotor from crashing below the minimum altitude in the presence of unknown disturbances. Our approach obeys the altitude constraint by calculating the backup flow under a reconstruction of the disturbance. Further, since the backup controller is designed to satisfy input bounds, the safe controller is guaranteed to respect these bounds as well. Click the thumbnail below to watch!
